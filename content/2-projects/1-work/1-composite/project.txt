Textproject: 

A small tool I created during my first semester at (link: http://www.itp.nyu.edu text: ITP) to compose images from a bunch of photos I have collected during a period of time from the internet, scanned from magazines and books and film photos taken by me, plus the intervention of random users during a show exhibition. As a result, the new images are outputted to a twitter account (@compositeDevice) and saved to an auto-generated PDF Book. This project was created using an Arduino Uno, Node.Js and Image Magick.
