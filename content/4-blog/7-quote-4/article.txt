Title: Quote #4

----

Quote: "When you use social media, time passes so quickly. It is like you are living in another reality where time travels at a different speed. I fully enjoy this experience. It is a very high state, like that in Zen Buddhist philosophy, to not have self-consciousness and to forget your own existence."
