Title: Quote #3

----

Quote: “I love books. Yet I’ve never bought one just to own it. What fascinates me is their utility value: books can teach us things. It’s not only the writer that speaks to us. If we listen more closely, we can hear the voice of the designer or eavesdrop on the concert of materials. Books appeal not only to our eyes and ears: some we fall in love with the moment we take them in our hands. Many books also communicate non-verbally – they can flirt and seduce.”
